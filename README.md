# 🏠 Spatial Room — A Calm Digital Ownership Space

A browser-based 3D room where users can decorate, personalize, and express identity in a spatial environment instead of traditional flat feeds.

This project explores a simple idea:

- What if personal profiles were spaces, not pages?

### Instead of scrolling through text and images, users interact with a room they control — placing objects, customizing layout, and shaping a digital territory.

# ✨ Core Concept

Modern web experiences feel flat — mostly text, images, and endless feeds.

This project experiments with:

- Spatial ownership
- Calm interaction
- Minimal, cozy environments
- Expressive customization

The goal is to create a digital space that feels personal rather than consumable.

# 🚀 Current Version (v0.1)

This version focuses only on interaction quality.

Implemented:

- Base 3D room

- Asset inventory panel

- Add assets to scene

- Basic object placement

- Limited rotation control

- Zustand-based state management

- React Three Fiber scene architecture

Not implemented (intentionally):

- Backend

- Authentication

- Multiplayer

- Saving system

- Marketplace

- Premium assets

The priority is validating the core interaction experience before scaling.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

Frontend:

- React

- Vite

- React Three Fiber

- Three.js

- Zustand

- TailwindCSS

No backend in current version.

## 🧠 Architecture Direction

The system is designed to scale toward:

- Persistent rooms

- Public room sharing

- Social interaction

- Asset marketplace

- Premium digital items

- Spatial identity profiles

Current focus is interaction satisfaction before infrastructure complexity.

# 🎯 Vision

This project is an experiment in moving from:

Flat profile pages
→
Spatial digital identity

Instead of showing content, users shape an environment.

If the experience feels meaningful and engaging, the system will evolve toward:

- Persistent online rooms

- Shareable links

- Social visitation

- Status signaling through rare assets

## ⚠️ Status

Active experimental build.

Focus:
Interaction quality > feature quantity.

## 🧪 Why This Exists

Because the web feels increasingly uniform and feed-driven.

This project explores whether:

Calm + Ownership + Spatial Presence

can create a more emotionally engaging digital space.

## 📌 Future Roadmap (Exploratory)

- Grid snapping & collision control

- Transform controls

- Save room layout locally

- Public room sharing

- Backend integration

- Asset monetization system
